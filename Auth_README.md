Security Concerns with innerHTML:
1. XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) Risk:
	Your Code is Safer Because:
	You're using static templates (no user input interpolation)
	No dynamic values are being inserted into the HTML string
	The content is controlled by your code, not external sources

 Use document.createElement() (Most Secure)
 the Modern approach uses Template Elements

 in the HTML 
 ```html
 <!-- In your HTML -->
<template id="register-form-template">
  <div class="reg-header">
    <h1>Register</h1>
  </div>
  <form id="register-form">
    <!-- form content -->
  </form>
</template>
 ```
 in the JS
 ```javascript
 export function renderRegisterForm() {
  const container = document.querySelector('.log-container');
  const template = document.getElementById('register-form-template');
  const clone = template.content.cloneNode(true);
  
  container.innerHTML = '';
  container.appendChild(clone);
}
 ```

 Recommendation for Your Project:
Your current approach is acceptable for this project because:

It's static content
No user input is being injected
It's readable and maintainable
For production applications, consider:

Using a framework like React, Vue, or Angular that handles this safely
Using template engines with automatic escaping
Following the createElement() approach for dynamic content

Static Templates (What you're doing - SAFER):
Static templates are HTML strings that are hardcoded in your JavaScript - they don't change based on user input.

Why it's safer: The HTML content is predictable and controlled by you, the developer. No external data can modify what gets inserted.

User Input Interpolation (DANGEROUS):
User input interpolation means inserting dynamic values (especially from users) directly into HTML strings using template literals ${}.


```javascript
// DANGEROUS EXAMPLE - USER INPUT INTERPOLATION
const userName = document.getElementById("some-input").value; // User types this!
const userMessage = getUserMessage(); // Comes from user!

container.innerHTML = `
  <div class="welcome">
    <h1>Welcome ${userName}!</h1>
    <p>Your message: ${userMessage}</p>
  </div>
`;
```
it being hardcoded is a safe approach, the problem is using placeholders

other approaches:
function escapeHtml(text) {
  const div = document.createElement('div');
  div.textContent = text;
  return div.innerHTML;
}

const safeUserName = escapeHtml(userName);
container.innerHTML = `<h1>Welcome ${safeUserName}!</h1>`;

Your Code is Safe Because:
You're not doing this:

// You're NOT doing this (which would be dangerous)
container.innerHTML = `<input value="${someUserInput}">`;

You're doing this:

// You ARE doing this (which is safe)
container.innerHTML = `<input placeholder="Full Name" required />`;
